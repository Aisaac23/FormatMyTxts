# FormatMyTxts

The main purpose of this tool, is to allow you to give format to one ore more plain text files at once. It is inspired and aimed to create Comma Separated Values files but you can use it for multiple purposes.

## Features:

  * You won’t visualize the file so make sure to create a back-up of your files before hitting the “Apply and save” button, in case you don’t like the results.

  * It’s small, simple to use and it doesn’t use a lot of memory.

  * When you activate the “Delete all...” action, the application will delete everything that’s before or after the first occurrence of the text indicated in the text-field next to the “before” and “after” buttons.
  * The “Replace… with”  action will replace all the occurrences of the first input with the second one.
  * The “Normalize by… ” action will replace all the white spaces with one you selected (space, tab or new-line) and will delete any consecutive repeated ones. Additionally you can select the “Clear commas” option to remove all the “,” comma symbols in your files.

  * The “Group data”  action, will group every word (string delimited by spaces) with the character you’ve indicated in the text-field by the size you’ve indicated in the spinner.

  * Finally you can make all words lowercase or uppercase.
